## Question 1

### How do you indicate that a class represents an entity to store in a Room database?

* Make the class extend DatabaseEntity.

* **Annotate the class with @Entity.**

* Annotate the class with @Database.

* Make the class extend RoomEntity and also annotate the class with @Room.

## Question 2

### The DAO (data access object) is an interface that Room uses to map Kotlin functions to database queries.

### How do you indicate that an interface represents a DAO for a Room database?

* Make the interface extend RoomDAO.

* Make the interface extend EntityDao, then implement the DaoConnection() method.

* Annotate the interface with @Dao.

* Annotate the interface with @RoomConnection.

## Question 3

### Which of the following statements are true about the Room database? Choose all that apply.

* You can define tables for a Room database as annotated data classes.

* If you return LiveData from a query, Room will keep the LiveData updated for you if the LiveData changes.

* Each Room database must have one, and only one, DAO.

* To identify a class as a Room database, make it a subclass of RoomDatabase and annotate it with @Database.

## Question 4

### Which of the following annotations can you use in your @Dao interface? Choose all that apply.

* @Get

* @Update

* @Insert

* @Query

## Question 5

### How can you verify that your database is working? Select all that apply.

* Write instrumented tests.

* Continue writing and running the app until it displays the data.

* Replace the calls to the methods in the DAO interface by calls to equivalent methods in the Entity class.

* Run the verifyDatabase() function provided by the Room library.

## Question 1

### Which of the following is not a benefit of using coroutines?:

* They are non-blocking

* They run asynchronously.

* They can be run on a thread other than the main thread.

* They always make app runs faster.

* They can use exceptions.

* They can be written and read as linear code.

## Question 2

### Which of the following is not true for suspend functions.?

* An ordinary function annotated with the suspend keyword.

* A function that can be called inside coroutines.

* While a suspend function is running, the calling thread is suspended.

* Suspend functions must always run in the background.

## Question 3

### Which of the following statements is NOT true?

* When execution is blocked, no other work can be executed on the blocked thread.

* When execution is suspended, the thread can do other work while waiting for the offloaded work to complete.

* Suspending is more efficient, because threads may not be waiting, doing nothing.

* Whether blocked or suspended, execution is still waiting for the result of the coroutine before continuing.
